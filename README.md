☕ Coffee Machine Simulation – Python Project

This is a Python-based Coffee Machine simulation project built as part of the “100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp”. It runs in the console and allows users to purchase drinks like espresso, latte, and cappuccino by inserting virtual coins. The program manages resources, tracks profit, and provides reports just like a real coffee machine.

⸻

🚀 Features
	•	Offers 3 coffee options: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino
	•	Accepts coins: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies
	•	Calculates total money inserted and returns change if applicable
	•	Tracks and deducts resources (water, milk, coffee) with each purchase
	•	Generates a resource report on demand
	•	Option to shut down the machine via a command

⸻

📋 How It Works
	1.	The user is prompted to choose a drink (espresso, latte, cappuccino)
	2.	The machine checks if there are enough ingredients.
	3.	If resources are sufficient, it asks for coin input.
	4.	It then:
	•	Verifies the total payment
	•	Provides change if needed
	•	Deducts used resources
	•	Serves the coffee!
	5.	Typing "report" prints the current resources and profit.
	6.	Typing "off" stops the machine.
